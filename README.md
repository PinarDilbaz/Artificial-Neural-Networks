# Artificial-Neural-Networks
--I have used the version of Python 3.9.7 <br /> 
--I have used Microsoft Windows for operating system
--There is only main.py file, I didn't divide my code to separate files.
--First we need to download Individual Edition - Anaconda
--After, we need to Run this Command: conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
--I used 'Visual Studio Code' as the platform where I write my code. However,
I open visual studio code via anaconda navigator.
--Pytorch library is used in this code.
--When you run the code on your own computer,
it will directly download and manipulate the CIFAR-10 dataset.
